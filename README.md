# x86 Assembly Programs

Hey there! If you are a student from CSUF who happen to
take CPSC-240 with professor Floyd Holliday, you are in luck!
Here I will post previous homework assignments and exams in case
you want to use these as resources.

This repository contains x86 assembly programs mixed with some
C++ and C programming.

Best of luck!
