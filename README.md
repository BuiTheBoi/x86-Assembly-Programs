# x86 Assembly Programs

Hey there! If you are a student from CSUF who happen to
take CPSC-240 with professor Floyd Holliday, you are in luck!
Here I will post previous homework assignments and exams in case
you want to use these as resources.

This repository contains x86 assembly programs mixed with some
C++ and C programming. I developed each program using Visual Studio Code
combined with Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL).

Best of luck!

## How to run each program

Each folder contains a bash file either called r.sh or run.sh to compile
or assemble each C/C++/Assembly file. Don't worry about compiling/assembling
each manually.

To make your life easier, I have included Bash files either named r.sh or
run.sh that does just that. If you are using a Linux environment, type in "sh
r.sh" or "sh run.sh" wihout the quotes (Depending on the name of each bash file) 
in your shell to run each program.
